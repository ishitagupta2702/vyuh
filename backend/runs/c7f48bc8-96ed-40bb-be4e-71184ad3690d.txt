Love bombing is a dangerous manipulation tactic employed by individuals with narcissistic traits to ensnare their victims. This insidious technique involves showering the victim with excessive flattery, declarations of love, and grand gestures early on in a relationship, paving the way for control and dependency to take root. While victims may initially bask in the attention and feel flattered, love bombing eventually leads to a cycle of control and abuse. Recognizing the signs of love bombing, such as unrealistic promises and isolation from loved ones, is crucial in safeguarding oneself. By setting boundaries and seeking support, individuals can protect themselves from the emotionally draining effects of love bombing and empower themselves to address manipulative behaviors within their relationships.
